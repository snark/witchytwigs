Stories can and often do build surprises by encouraging audiences to attribute certain assertions, presuppositions, and evaluations to an “objective” or base-level perspective, only to reveal later on that these elements should be attributed only to the mistaken or deceptive viewpoint of a particular character. This paper presents a comparison of sound design and viewpoint phenomena in Francis Ford Coppola's film _The Conversation_ (1974) with similar narrative twists in prose and with other perspective shifts in film. It shows how viewpoint blends, shifts, and distinctions between the “viewpointed” and “non-viewpointed” status of elements in the visual and auditory stream in film can work together to create this kind of re-evaluation surprise, and discusses how these are and are not analogous to similar effects in prose.
