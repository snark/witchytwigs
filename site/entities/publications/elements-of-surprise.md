Why do some surprises delight--the endings of Agatha Christie novels, films like _Get Out_, the sudden awareness that Pip’s benefactor is not (and never was!) Miss Havisham? _Elements of Surprise_ explains how our brains conspire with stories to produce those revelatory plots that define a "well-made surprise."

By tracing the prevalence of surprise endings in both literary fiction and popular literature and showing how they exploit our mental limits, this book upends two common beliefs. The first is cognitive science’s tendency to treat biases as a form of moral weakness and failure. The second is certain critics' presumption that surprise endings are mere shallow gimmicks. The latter is simply not true, and the former tells at best half the story. Building a good plot twist is a complex art that reflects a sophisticated understanding of the human mind, and many of the finest feats of characterization rely on the same mechanics that power the machinery of plot.

_Elements of Surprise_ describes how cognitive biases, mental shortcuts, and quirks of memory help to produce wondrous illusions, and also provides a novel how-to guide for writers. The interactions of plot and cognition reveal the interdependencies of surprise, sympathy, and sense-making, inviting a new appreciation of the pleasures of being had.
